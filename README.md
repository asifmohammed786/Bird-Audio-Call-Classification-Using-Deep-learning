# Bird Call Detection 🐦🔊

A deep learning project that detects the presence of **Capuchin bird calls** from raw audio signals.

## 📌 Overview
This notebook performs **bird call detection** using:
- Audio preprocessing
- Mel-spectrogram generation
- CNN-based signal presence detection

The model predicts **if a call is present or not**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Librosa (for audio → mel-spectrogram)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Objective
To detect whether a Capuchin bird call exists in a given audio file, even under noisy conditions.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Real-time detection using microphones  
- Deploying on edge devices or stream-based input
